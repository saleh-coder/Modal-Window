# Modal Window Project

This project demonstrates how to build a simple modal window component using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The modal opens when clicking one of the buttons and can be closed by clicking a close button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the `Esc` key.

## Key Features:
- **Modal opening**: Opens when clicking one of the trigger buttons.
- **Multiple ways to close the modal**:
  - Click the close button.
  - Click outside the modal (on the overlay).
  - Press the `Esc` key.
- **CSS class manipulation**: Uses CSS classes to show/hide the modal and overlay.
- **DOM manipulation**: Efficient handling of user interactions and dynamic changes to HTML elements via JavaScript.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the modal and buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the modal and overlay, including showing and hiding elements.
- **JavaScript**: For handling events like opening and closing the modal.
  
## How It Works:
1. Modal structure: The modal is defined in the HTML but hidden by default using a .hidden CSS class.
2. Event handling: JavaScript is used to add event listeners to the buttons, enabling the modal to appear and disappear.
3. Key interactions: The modal can be closed by clicking the overlay or pressing the Esc key.

## Future Enhancements:
Add animations when the modal appears/disappears.
Make the modal more responsive for different screen sizes.
