# UI Component Project - Modal Window

This project aims to build a **User Interface (UI) component**: an interactive **modal window**. Modal windows are widely used on websites to display content overlaid on top of the existing interface, providing a focused user experience.

## Features (Planned)

- **Open/Close Modal**: The modal window will be opened by clicking one of several buttons and closed via multiple interactions.
  - By clicking the close button inside the modal.
  - By clicking outside the modal (on the dark overlay).
  - By pressing the **Esc** key on the keyboard.
- **Overlay**: A dark background will cover the rest of the page when the modal is active, providing a clear focus on the modal content.
- **Responsive Design**: The modal and its interactions will work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A text editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

## Project Structure (Planned)

HTML: Will include the basic structure for the modal and buttons.

CSS: Will style the modal, the dark overlay, and other UI elements.

JavaScript: Will handle opening and closing the modal, as well as interactions via buttons and the keyboard.

## Future Goals

1.  Add animations to the modal (e.g., fade-in and fade-out effects).

2.  Improve accessibility for screen readers.

3.  Add more complex functionality, such as nested modals or customizable content inside the modal.
